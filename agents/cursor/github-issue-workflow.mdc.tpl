# GitHub issue triage & delivery

Canonical: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/github-workflow.md`

## When this applies

Any **feature**, **bug**, **improvement**, or stakeholder request — even without "create an issue".

**Exceptions (implement directly):**
- User names an issue: *Implement #5*, *Fix #12*, *work on #N*
- User says *skip issue*, *just fix*, *no issue* (trivial only)
- Pure questions

## Phase 1 — Triage (default; do not implement)

1. **Understand** — restate outcome in one line.
2. **Codebase** — search/read; note gaps and files.
3. **Duplicates** — `gh issue list --repo {{GH_REPO}} --state open --search "…"`
4. **Create issue** via `./scripts/gh-triage-issue.sh`:
   - Title: `[Bug]:` / `[Feature]:`
   - Body: follow `docs/issue-body.example.md` — must include `## Acceptance criteria` with `- [ ]`
   - Labels: `bug` or `enhancement`; `priority:…`; `client-facing` if user would notice
5. **Board** — script adds to project; sync Priority/Focus.
6. **Reply** — issue URL, summary, priority; **do not code**.

End with: *"Review the issue; tell me which # to implement first."*

## Phase 2 — Implement (only after user picks)

Triggers: *Implement #N*, *kerjakan #N*, *LGTM on #N*, *approved #N*.

1. Read acceptance criteria.
2. Focused diff; tests when non-trivial.
3. PR: `Fixes #N`; changelog if user-facing.
4. Commits only when user asks.

## Phase 3 — Close-out after QA

Triggers: user says fix **works** / **ok** / **sudah work** for **#N**.

1. Verify AC in codebase + commits.
2. `./scripts/gh-close-verified-issue.sh N --comment-file …`
3. Do not ask user to checklist manually.

## Merge & push (when user asks)

{{MERGE_PUSH_SECTION}}

## Branch check (AI)

Before any merge/push instructions, run **`git branch -a`**. Use `.workflow-kit.env` (`SINGLE_BRANCH`, `INTEGRATION_BRANCH`, `PRODUCTION_BRANCH`). If docs mention `dev` but the branch does not exist, follow **single-branch** rules in `AGENTS.md` — never invent branches.

## Constants

| Key | Value |
|-----|--------|
| Repo | `{{GH_REPO}}` |
| Project | {{PROJECT_BOARD_URL}} |

Requires `gh` with `repo` + `project` scopes.
