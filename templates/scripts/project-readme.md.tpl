# {{PROJECT_TITLE}} — project board

Dev board for **{{GH_REPO}}** (solo dev + AI workflow).

## Flow

1. **Triage** → issue on board (**Backlog** / **Todo**).
2. Human moves to **Ready for AI** when autonomous work is authorized (or implement via chat).
3. Agent implements → **AI Working** → self-verify → **AI Review** → PR.
4. Human reviews PR → **Human Review** / **QA**.
5. Merge → confirm *works* → close issue → **Done**.
