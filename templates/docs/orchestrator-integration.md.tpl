# Orchestrator integration ({{PROJECT_TITLE}})

Optional guide for external AI execution systems (Paperclip, custom workers, CI agents). **This repository does not ship orchestrator code** — GitHub Issues + Project Status remain the source of truth.

**Any orchestrator** that implements this contract is supported — Paperclip is one example, not a dependency. To switch tools later, keep GitHub as the source of truth and rewire only the control plane (poll/webhook, spawn agent, update Status). Coding agents (Cursor, Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Hermes, etc.) keep reading `AGENTS.md`; no kit changes required.

## Concepts

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| GitHub Issue | Unit of work + acceptance criteria |
| Project **Status** | Workflow state + **authorization** for autonomous runs |
| Labels | Metadata only (`complexity:*`, `ai-blocked`) — **not** execution triggers |
| Coding agent | Cursor, Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, etc. — reads `AGENTS.md` |
| Orchestrator | Polls board, assigns one issue per run |
| Pull Request | Reviewable output — human merges |

**Never** use an `ai-ready` **label** as the primary trigger. Only **Ready for AI** on the Project board authorizes orchestrator pickup.

## Board setup

```bash
./scripts/gh-ensure-project-status.sh
```

Adds **Ready for AI**, **AI Working**, **AI Review**, **Human Review** without moving existing cards (Todo / In Progress / QA / Done stay put).

## Orchestrator loop

1. Poll GitHub Project for items with Status = **Ready for AI**.
2. Pick **one** issue (respect cost principles — no backlog drain).
3. Spawn coding agent with: issue URL, repo clone, `AGENTS.md`.
4. Agent moves issue → **AI Working**, implements on branch/worktree, runs tests, self-verifies.
5. Agent opens/updates PR, moves → **AI Review**, posts summary + test results + limitations.
6. Human reviews PR (**Human Review** / **QA**), merges when satisfied.
7. Human confirms *sudah work* → agent or human runs `gh-close-verified-issue.sh` → **Done**.

## Status script keys

```bash
./scripts/gh-set-issue-status.sh <N> ready-for-ai   # human only
./scripts/gh-set-issue-status.sh <N> ai-working     # agent start
./scripts/gh-set-issue-status.sh <N> ai-review      # after verify
./scripts/gh-set-issue-status.sh <N> human-review   # human PR review
./scripts/gh-set-issue-status.sh <N> done
```

Legacy boards: `ai-working` → **In Progress**, `ai-review` / `human-review` → **QA** when new columns are missing.

## Interactive Cursor (no orchestrator)

Humans can still say *Implement #N* or `/implement` — that is **chat authorization**, not board authorization. Orchestrators must still require **Ready for AI**.

## Blocked work

If the agent cannot proceed, comment on the issue with:

1. What is ambiguous or risky
2. What decision is required
3. Options
4. What information is needed

Add label `ai-needs-human` or `ai-blocked` (metadata). Do **not** merge or close without human direction.

## Paperclip (example)

Paperclip or similar tools can:

- Watch the linked GitHub Project
- Filter `Status == Ready for AI`
- Delegate to a configured coding agent runtime
- Respect `VERIFY_MAX_ROUNDS` and autonomy boundaries in `AGENTS.md`

No Paperclip-specific configuration lives in this kit — wire your orchestrator to the Status field above.

See also `AGENTS.md` and `docs/github-workflow.md`.
